Storm - Still in development
============================

Domain oriented ORM, crafted with passion for PHP 5.4+.

Storm is not finished, the foundation and architecture is there, but the codebase has almost no unit tests. Since storm was originally a learning exercise with the goal of creating an orm that does not influence the domain model, this project has maintained a good code quality, but it is quickly becoming apparent that I cannot single handedly develop and maintain this project, especially with school. Serious contributors are needed, please feel free to clone the repository and look around the code base, if you have any questions, inquiries or want to begin contributing please email me at: [elliot@aanet.com.au](mailto:elliot@aanet.com.au).

Please be aware that this is my first large open source project, so any tips/recommendations are welcome.

Summary of the current state of Storm
=====================================
 - ORM [functionality is running](https://github.com/TimeToogo/Storm/blob/master/Example/One/Example.php) but far from stable.
 - Overall, maintains a [good code quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/TimeToogo/Storm).
 - Plenty of work is required just [to set up](https://github.com/TimeToogo/Storm/tree/master/Example/One).
 - Decent size codebase (~15,000 LOC).
 - [API](https://github.com/TimeToogo/Storm/tree/master/Storm/Storm/Api) structure is not finialized.
 - Apalling [test suite](https://github.com/TimeToogo/Storm/tree/master/Tests/Storm/Tests).
 - Lacking in documentation / code comments.
 - Serious contributors [are needed](mailto:elliot@aanet.com.au).

The goals of Storm
==================
 - To provide a maintainable and sensible approach to the complex ORM realm.
 - To reward the user with unpolluted and [flexible domain models](#domainmodels).
 - To provide a fluent [language integrated query (Similar to C#'s LINQ)](#phpinq)
 - To [reduce the amount of queries](#queries) to the underlying platform and assist in [eliminating n+1 queries](#queries).

What Storm is not
=================
 - The much loved active record pattern (although possible in the future).
 - The answer to all your problems.

<a name="domainmodels"></a>Storm - Flexible domain models
=========================================================
**Storm aims to provide as little restriction to domain models as possible**
 - Storm natively supports: fields, getters/setters and even indexors or innvocation as entity properties.
 - Your entities can remain completely unaware of Storm: no base class, no annotations and no persistence logic.
 - Seamless identifying and non-identifying relationships between entities:
     - Required child entity - A `User` has a `Profile`
     - Optional child entity - A `User` may have a `CreditCard`
     - [Array](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php)/[Traversable](http://au1.php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php) of many child entities - A `User` has multiple `Posts`, *Traversable must be used for lazy loading*
 - Value Objects
 - Polymorphic Types

<a name="phpinq"></a>Storm - PHP integerated query
==================================================
 - Code in terms of the domain, not your database (SQL).
 - Abstract yourself from the underlying database.
 - Maintain full IDE auto-completion.
 - Remove the hassle of magic strings and prevent SQL injection.

**Requests (`SELECT`) - Example:**
```php
$MiddleAgedUsersRequest = $UserRepository->Request()
        ->Where(function (User $User) {
            return $User->GetAge() > 20 && $User->GetAge() < 50 && $User->IsActive();
        })
        ->OrderByDescending(function (User $User) { return $User->GetLastLoginDate(); })
        ->Limit(20)
        ->AsArray();
        
$SomeActiveMiddleAgedUsers = $UserRepository->Load($MiddleAgedUsersRequest);
```


**Procedures (`UPDATE`) - Example:**
```php
$InactiveUserProcedure = $UserRepository->Procedure(
        function (User $User) {
            $User->SetIsActive(false);
            $User->SetInactivationDate(new DateTime());
        })
        ->Where(function (User $User) {
            return $User->GetLastLoginDate() < (new DateTime())->sub(new DateInterval('P2Y'));
        }); 

$UserRepository->Execute($InactiveUserProcedure);
```

*NOTE: The supplied functions never actually executed, they are parsed and then mapped to the underlying platform as queries.*


<a name="queries"></a>Storm - Sensible querying
===============================================
**One main goal of Storm is to take advantage of the underlying database as much as possible.**
 - Storm will use batch inserts/upserts and deletes where possible.
 - Elimination of the dreaded N+1 query scenario introduced by excessive lazy loading. With storm, there are currenlty multiple relationship loading implementations:
     - `Eager` - Relationships are loaded along with the parent and children are joined where appropriate.
     - `Global scope lazy` - Relationships are not loaded with the parent entity but when one is required, globally every unloaded relationship will be loaded .
     - `Request scope lazy` (Recommended) - Relationships are loaded when required for all entities in the request object graph.
     - `Parent scope lazy` (N+1 likely) - Relationships are loaded when required from for each parent entity.



**Example:**

User is the parent entity, a user has many posts and a post has an author and many tags.
*Here is the typical N+1 scenario.*
```php
$User = $UserRepository->LoadById(1);
foreach($User->GetPosts() as $Post) {
    $Post->GetAuthor()->GetFullName();
    foreach($Post->GetTags() as $Tag) {
        $Tag->GetName();
    }
}
```
Now here is the number of queries executed for each loading mode (N=Number of Posts);
 - `Eager` - **3** (the user | posts joined with the author | all tags), when the user is loaded.
 - `Global scope lazy` - For loading a single request this is equivalent to `Request scope lazy` mode below.
 - `Request scope lazy` - **4** (the user | posts | all authors | all tags), the posts will be loaded when `$User->GetPosts()` is iterated and all the tags will be loaded when the first `$Post->GetTags()` is iterated.
 - `Parent scope lazy` - **(N * 2) + 2** - (user | posts | *each post's* author | *each post's* tags).

*NOTE: Relationship loading mode is per-relationship, the above example assumes every relationship will have one loading mode for simplicity.*
