The near future:
 - Finish implementing discarding of entities ~
 - Begin to document existing functionality ~
 - Redo all exceptions with meaningful exception classes and intuitive error messages ~
 - Refactor property expression mapping into the IPropertyMapping
 - Release to the public
 - Add user friendly name for IProperty when exceptions are thrown 
 - Break apart the DomainDatabaseMap into more concise classes
 - 

The future:
 - Extend fluent request functionality (multiple types of joins, maybe the having clause + others)
 - Implement CodeFirst driver
 - Finalize the API
 - Begin writing a test suite for the major parts of the application
 - Implement an active record flavour of Storm (This could be quite sexy coupled with fluent requests)
 - Implement other platforms for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle
 - Restructure UnitOfWork / Transaction such that the order of operations is preserved
 - Built-in support for optimistic / pessimistic locking ?
 - 

The far future:
 - Introduce migrations and advanced database syncing
 - Extend fluent request functionality via relationship properties (maps to subqueries and joins)
 - Begin a peformance lockdown, make sure Storm is peformant as possible. (milliseconds matter)
 - Begin to investigate possible edge cases and tie up any loose ends
 - Extend the test suite to cover >80% of code
 - 

The very far future:
 - Build a wiki with the complete API and many tutorials.
 - Build a website for the community
 - Cli? Gui?
 - Rewrite the Closure AST parsing with specialized parser (remove dependency of Nikic's PHPParser)
